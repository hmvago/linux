If there is anything like a driver's license for safe bash coding, it must be rule zero of BashPitfalls (http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls ): Always use quotes.
Quoting inhibits word splitting and indirect pathname expansion, both for variables and command substitutions.

Variable expansion:

    Good: "$my_var"
    Bad: $my_var

Command substitution:

    Good: "$(cmd)"
    Bad: $(cmd)
